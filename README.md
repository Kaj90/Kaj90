- Hi, Iâ€™m @Kaj90
- Iâ€™m currently studying data science on CodeCademy. The Data Science foundations I completed outside of the codecademy environment have been uploaded here. So far the Machine Learning projects have been within the CodeCademy environment so I have not been able to post them here.
